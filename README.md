## üåª Lilium

Lilium is the native token of the [Wayports](https://www.wayports.app/) community. The intent is to produce a deflationary token, so that the market value of the asset is always ascending in the broader picture. Besides that, we want to create an environment that is friendly and welcoming to the newcomers of the crypto world, but can also accommodate the needs of users who are already familiar with how blockchains work and know how to store and manage their assets.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Minting

Users will be able to mint new Lilium units by joining the [Wayports Racing League](https://wrl.wayports.app/) events. The competition takes place inside [Live For Speed](https://www.lfs.net/), a racing simulator game, and at the end of each race the drivers will receive a base amount of Lilium and a bonus for their final position in the race standings.

Every Wayports Racing League event will have its data persisted in the Flow blockchain. At the end of each race, a bot running in a server will be responsible for collecting the final stands alongside with the time that each driver took to finish the race and nsert that into a function in the WRL Events contract.insert that into a function in the WRL Events contract.

After the final results are added to the blockchain, a group of stewards will be responsible for analyzing possible incidents and decide if any driver should receive a penalty. Once the stewards reach consensus on the race results and penalties, then the WRL Events contract will allow the Account Admin to run the minting function, which will mint the tokens according to the race results.

The competition has a limited amount of participants that can go as high as 35 rewarded drivers per week.

## ü§ù Creating a market for Lilium

As mentioned above, Lilium will be used inside the Wayports ecosystem as a mean to execute transactions. The first use case designed for Lilium's transacting value is the subscription fee for another racing competition, which will take place in the Forza racing games.

Members of the Wayports community who want to participate in this competition will need to buy Lilium from the drivers who minted the coin the first competition described above, in order to pay the subscription fee for this new event.

The purchase of the asset will be made via an Exchange inside [Quantum](https://quantum.wayports.app/), the financial arm of Wayports, where drivers will be able to place offers for their Lilium and users will be able to buy the currency by depositing the amount necessary, while the contract will do the swap for the users.

Lilium will also be used in the upcoming NFT marketplace, Unum, which will allow members of the Wayports community to sell their creations in exchange for Lilium.

The last use case for Lilium will be the staking program, available for subscribers of the Quantum Premium plan, where users will receive more Lilium in exchange of the amount of cryptocurrency they stake in the staking pool.
